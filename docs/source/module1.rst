Module 1: Tools
===============

All you need to code and run Python is Python installed on your system and a text editor. However, 
there are lots of petty annoyances involved with writing, running, documenting, distributing, and 
maintaining Python code. Many tools exist to alleviate these burdens. This module will introduce 
you to a professional cohort of tools we will be using throughout the course. This is a slightly 
different approach to many Python courses where the language is focused on first and the tools are
either introduced later or left to the student to discover. I think this is backwards for several 
reasons:

1. We, as programmers, do not need to be tool experts. A chef, generally does not know how a knife is
   made. They exist to do work for us and ease our suffering. Even a cursory understanding of what 
   exists and what it does for you will make your programming experience easier and more sustainable.
   If a tool requires more than a cursory understanding of it to be useful, it is not a good tool.

2. Bad habits form early. Great tools have a way of forcing good habits on you. Programming at its
   core is the repeated application of patterns seen over and over again. The best way to get good
   at it fast, is to see early and often how great code is put together and great code always uses 
   the best tools of the day.

By the end of this module we will understand the basics of what the stack of tools we are using for
this course is doing for us and we will have them installed and ready to serve. We will also fork and
clone the course repository and complete our first programming assignment! The keynote presentation
