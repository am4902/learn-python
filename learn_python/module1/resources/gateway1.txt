Create a python executable script called gateway1 that prints Hello World! to the terminal. Then from this 
repository's root directory run:

poetry run pytest learn_python/module1/tests.py

If the tests pass hooray go to module 2!

Hint:
    You will need to edit pyproject.toml to add the script as an executable on the python path.
